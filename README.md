# Dual-Color Image Processing Pipeline

This repository contains a dual-color image processing pipeline implemented in Matlab. The pipeline is designed to process images captured from a dual-color imaging system and perform various image analysis tasks. Please check our current paper "[All-optical interrogation of brain-wide activity in freely swimming larval zebrafish](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.24.542114v1)" for more details.
